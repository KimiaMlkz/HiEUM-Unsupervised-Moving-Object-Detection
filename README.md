# HiEUM: Unsupervised Moving Object Detection (Re-implementation)

This repository contains an educational and qualitative re-implementation of the paper:

**Highly Efficient and Unsupervised Framework for Moving Object Detection in Satellite Videos**  
Chao Xiao et al., IEEE TPAMI.

## Overview
This project reproduces the main algorithmic pipeline of the HiEUM framework, including:
- Dataset reduction for hardware-limited environments
- Background modeling and motion extraction
- Initial sparse representation
- Pseudo-label generation and refinement
- Iterative self-evolution and sparse feedback
- Final moving object detection

The implementation focuses on qualitative analysis and algorithmic understanding rather than quantitative benchmarking.

## Original Work
- Official paper and code: https://github.com/ChaoXiao12/Moving-object-detection-in-satellite-videos-HiEUM

## Project Structure

The implementation is organized into sequential Jupyter notebooks,
each corresponding to one phase of the HiEUM framework:

- **Phase 0**: Dataset Reduction  
- **Phase 1**: Preprocessing  
- **Phase 2**: Background Modeling  
- **Phase 3**: Motion / Foreground Extraction  
- **Phase 4**: Sparse Motion Representation  
- **Phase 5**: Pseudo-label Generation  
- **Phase 6**: Label Refinement  
- **Phase 7**: Self-Evolution  
- **Phase 8**: Sparse Feedback  
- **Phase 9**: Final Detection  

All notebooks are located in the `notebooks/` directory and should be executed in order.

## Qualitative Results

Below are qualitative results from different phases of the HiEUM pipeline:

### Phase 2 – Foreground Motion Overlay

This figure illustrates the foreground motion extraction result in Phase 2 of the HiEUM framework. Detected moving regions are overlaid on the original satellite image after background modeling.


### Phase 2 – Binary Foreground Mask (Ground Truth)

This figure shows the binary foreground mask generated from bounding box annotations. White pixels represent moving objects, while black pixels indicate static background regions.
